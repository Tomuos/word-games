## Description

This is a collection of word games that I have written in javascript.  The games currently being worked on is:

phonetic memory game - a game where you have to match the phonetic spelling of a word to a word that sounds similar. Such as "fog" and "log".

The idea is to help learning with sight, sound and memorization.
